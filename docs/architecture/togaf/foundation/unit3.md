The `ADM`, Architecture Development Method, is a detailed step by step process for developing or changing an enterprise architecture (EA)

## Phases

### Preliminary Phase

Determine the Architecture Capability desired by the organization:
* Review the organizational context for conducting Enterprise Architecture
* Identify and scope the elements of the enterprise organizations
* Identify the established frameworks, methods, and processes
* Establish Capability Maturity target

Establish the Architecture Capability:
* Define and establish the Organizational Model
* Define and establish the detailed process and resources for Architecture Governance
* Select and implement tools that support the Architecture Capability
* Define the Architecture Principles

Deliverables: 
* Request for Architecture Work (Demande de mise en chantier d'architecture)
* Architecture Principles

### Phase A: Architecture Vision

* Define the scope of the Architecture Project
* Identify stakeholders, concerns, and associated requirements
* Assess the capability of the Enterprise Architecture team

Deliverables:
* Statement of Architecture Work (stakeholders need to agree on a summary of the target)
* Architecture Vision

### Phase B: Business Architecture
Development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision

Focus Areas: Business processes, organizational structure, capabilities, roles

### Phase C: Information Systems Architectures
Development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed Architecture Vision

Divided into two sub-phases:

Data Architecture: Define data entities, relationships, data governance

Application Architecture: Identify applications, their interactions, and alignment with business needs

### Phase D: Technology Architecture
Define the logical and physical technology infrastructure to support the agreed Architecture Vision

Focus: Networks, platforms, services, and infrastructure technologies

### Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions
Initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases

Activities: Gap analysis, define solution building blocks (SBBs), roadmap components

### Phase F: Migration Planning
How to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan

Activities: Prioritize projects, assign resources, assess risks and costs

### Phase G: Implementation Governance
Architectural oversight of the implementation, to ensure that it aligns with architecture

Activities: Monitor, guide solution development, validate conformance

### Phase H: Architecture Change Management
Procedures for managing change to the new architecture

Activities: Monitor business and IT changes, update architecture as needed

### Requirements Management
Operates the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM. It's a continuous phase which ensures that any changes to requirements are handled through appropriate governance processes and reflected in all other phases

Role: Acts as a central repository and validation mechanism for all phases

## Scope
The scope of an architecture is first expressed in terms of `breadth`, `depth`, and `time`

* `Breadth`: what is the full extent of the enterprise, and what part of that extent will this architecting effort deal with?
* `Depth`: to what level of detail should the architecting effort go?
* `Time Period`: what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision, and does it make sense for the same period to be covered in the detailed Architecture Description?
