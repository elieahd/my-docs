The `ADM`, Architecture Development Method, is a detailed step by step process for developing or changing an enterprise architecture (EA)

## Phases

### Preliminary Phase
The preparation and initiation activities required to create an Architecture Capability including customization of the TOGAF framework and definition of Architecture Principles

Define architecture principles, establish governance, select tools, and frameworks.

### Phase A: Architecture Vision
The initial phase of an architecture development cycle. Information about defining the scope of the architecture development initiative, identifying the stakeholders, creating the Architecture Vision, and obtaining approval to proceed with the architecture development

Define the scope, vision, and stakeholders for the architecture effort.

Statement of Architecture Work, high-level vision, business case, stakeholder map.

### Phase B: Business Architecture
Development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision

Focus Areas: Business processes, organizational structure, capabilities, roles.

### Phase C: Information Systems Architectures
Development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed Architecture Vision

Divided into two sub-phases:

Data Architecture: Define data entities, relationships, data governance.

Application Architecture: Identify applications, their interactions, and alignment with business needs.

### Phase D: Technology Architecture
Define the logical and physical technology infrastructure to support the agreed Architecture Vision

Focus: Networks, platforms, services, and infrastructure technologies.

### Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions
Initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases

Activities: Gap analysis, define solution building blocks (SBBs), roadmap components.

### Phase F: Migration Planning
How to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan

Activities: Prioritize projects, assign resources, assess risks and costs.

### Phase G: Implementation Governance
Architectural oversight of the implementation, to ensure that it aligns with architecture

Activities: Monitor, guide solution development, validate conformance.

### Phase H: Architecture Change Management
Procedures for managing change to the new architecture

Activities: Monitor business and IT changes, update architecture as needed.

### Requirements Management
Operates the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM. It's a continuous phase which ensures that any changes to requirements are handled through appropriate governance processes and reflected in all other phases

Role: Acts as a central repository and validation mechanism for all phases.
