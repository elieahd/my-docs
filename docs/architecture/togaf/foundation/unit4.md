## Qualities of Architecture Principles

### Understandable

The underlying tenets can be quickly grasped and understood by individuals throughout the organization.

The intention of the principle is clear and unambiguous, so that violations, whether intentional or not, are minimized

### Robust

Enable good quality decisions about architectures and plans to be made, and enforceable policies and standards to be created. 

Each principle should be sufficiently definitive and precise to support consistent decision-making in complex, potentially controversial situations

### Complete

Every potentially important principle governing the management of information and technology for the organization is defined â€” the principles cover every situation perceived

### Consistent

Strict adherence to one principle may require a loose interpretation of another principle. 

The set of principles must be expressed in a way that allows a balance of interpretations. 

Principles should not be contradictory to the point where adhering to one principle would violate the spirit of another. 

Every word in a principle statement should be carefully chosen to allow consistent yet flexible interpretation

### Stable

Principles should be enduring, yet able to accommodate changes.

An amendment process should be established for adding, removing, or altering principles after they are ratified initially.
