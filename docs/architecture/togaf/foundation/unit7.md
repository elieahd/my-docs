### Stakeholders

`Stakeholders` are individuals, teams, organizations, or classes thereof, having an interest in a system. They are people who have key roles in, or concerns about, the system; for example, users, developers, etc.

### Concerns

`Concerns` are interests in a system relevant to one or more of its stakeholders. They may pertain to any aspect of the systemâ€™s functioning, development, or operation, including performance, reliability, security, distribution, and evolvability, and may determine acceptability of the system

### Architecture View

An `Architecture View` is a representation of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. 
An architect creates architecture models. An architecture view consists of parts of these, chosen to show stakeholders that their concerns are being met.

### Architecture Viewpoint

An `Architecture Viewpoint` defines the perspective from which an architecture view is taken. 
It defines how to construct and use an architecture view, the information needed, the modeling techniques for expressing and analyzing it, and a rationale for these choices (e.g., by describing the purpose and intended audience of the view). 

### Building blocks

Systems are built from collections of building blocks.
They can be defined at many levels of detail:
Groupings at the fundamental functional level capturing architecture requirements are known as Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)
Real products that can be procured or specific custom developments are known as Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)
