Governance is a decision-making process with a defined structure of relationships to direct and control the enterprise to achieve stated goals.

Architecture Governance typically operates within a hierarchy of governance structures which can include all of the following as distinct domains with their own disciplines and processes:

* Corporate Governance
* Technology Governance
* IT Governance
* Architecture Governance

## Benefits of Architecture Governance

* `Discipline` – All involved parties will have a commitment to adhere to procedures, processes, and authority structures established by the organization
* `Transparency` – All actions implemented and their decision support will be available for inspection by authorized organization and provider parties
* `Independence` – All processes, decision-making, and mechanisms used will be established so as to minimize or avoid potential conflicts of interest
* `Accountability` – Identifiable groups within the organization – e.g., governance boards who take actions or make decisions – are authorized and accountable for their actions
* `Responsibility` – Each contracted party is required to act responsibly to the organization and its stakeholders
* `Fairness` – All decisions taken, processes used, and their implementation will not be allowed to create unfair advantage to any one particular party
