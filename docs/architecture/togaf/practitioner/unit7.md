Effective requirements management is dependent upon clear traceability from the organizationâ€™s vision, mission, business model, and strategies through the most detailed statement of requirement.

Objectives of the Requirements Management Phase:

* Ensure that the Requirements Management process is sustained and operates for all relevant ADM phases
* Manage architecture requirements identified during any execution of the ADM cycle or a phase
* Ensure that relevant architecture requirements are available for use by each phase as the phase is executed

### Requirements Impact Assessment

Throughout the ADM, new information is collected relating to an architecture, new facts may come to light that invalidate existing aspects of the architecture.

A Requirements Impact Assessment assesses the current architecture requirements and specification to identify changes that should be made and the implications of those changes.

### Architecture Requirements Specification

* Provides a set of quantitative statements that outline what an implementation project must do in order to comply with the architecture
* Will typically form a major component of an implementation contract or contract for more detailed Architecture Definition

When new requirements arise, or existing ones are changed, a Requirements Impact Statement is generated, which identifies the phases of the ADM that need to be revisited to address the changes.

The statement goes through various iterations until the final version, which includes the full implications of the requirements (e.g., costs, timescales, and business metrics) on the architecture development.

Once requirements for the current ADM cycle have been finalized then the Architecture Requirements Specification should be updated.
