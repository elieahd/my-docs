## Key Steps to Identify Information

#### Identify stakeholders, concerns, and business requirements
Explore the EA Repository for superior architecture constraints and guidance. Do the Stakeholder Map. Be completely clear which stakeholders must be served and what they are worrying about.
 
#### Define scope
What problem are you solving? In terms of the EA Landscape (breadth and planning-horizon) and in terms of purpose, which will tend to confirm the necessary level of detail? Be completely clear where in the business cycle this architecture will be used.

#### Evaluate capabilities 
Take a hard look at the EA team and confirm the ability of the team to deliver on this architecture development project. A good EA team covers gaps in experience, skill, and bias to deliver the architecture that is useful, overcoming weaknesses of few members of the team.
