# Tech debt & refactoring

Allocate time for tech debt & refactoring 

> if you don't schedule refactoring your bugs will do it for you 

1. Tech debt is inevitable but manageable -> _every sprint adds complexity. Regular cleanup is survival_

2. Refactoring isn't extra work, it's product work -> _it improves speed, stability and morale_

3. Make it visible -> _track debt items like features, include them in planning_

4. Use boy scout rule -> _leave the code cleaner than you found it_

5. Even 10% of each sprint helps -> _small investments = big dividends over time_
