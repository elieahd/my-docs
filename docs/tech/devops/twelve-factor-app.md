The [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/) is a methodology for building applications.

These 12 best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to
the web.

| #  | Name                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | [Codebase](https://12factor.net/codebase)                     | One code base tracked in a version control. <br/> Each app should have a single code base (in `git` for example) that can be deployed to multiple environments (int, homol, prod)                        |
| 2  | [Dependencies](https://12factor.net/dependencies)             | Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies. <br/> Use a dependency manager (like `npm`, `maven`) and avoid relying on system-wide packages                                                              |
| 3  | [Config](https://12factor.net/config)                         | Store configuration in environment variables, not in code. <br/> This keeps secrets and environment-specific settings separate from the application logic                                                |
| 4  | [Backing services](https://12factor.net/backing-services)     | Treat external service (like databases, queues, caches, api, ...) as attached resources <br/> They should be easily swappable and replace without code changes (e.g. switching from MySQL to PostgreSQL) |
| 5  | [Build, release, run](https://12factor.net/build-release-run) | Strictly separate build, release, and run. <br/> Each stage should be independent and reproducible                                                                                                       |
| 6  | [Processes](https://12factor.net/processes)                   | Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. <br/> Persist state in a backing service (db, queue, ...) not in memory or local disk                                                                |
| 7  | [Port binding](https://12factor.net/port-binding)             | Export services via port binding. <br/> The app should be self-contained and not rely on an external web server, it should listen on a port and serve requests directly                                  |
| 8  | [Concurrency](https://12factor.net/concurrency)               | Scale out via the process models. <br/> Use multiple processes for different workloads (e.g. web, worker) instead of threads within a single process                                                     |
| 9  | [Disposability](https://12factor.net/disposability)           | Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. <br/> Processes should start quickly and handle termination cleanly to enable rapid scaling and deployment.                                 |
| 10 | [Dev/Prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)       | Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible. <br/> Minmize gaps in environment, dependencies, and processes to reduce deployment surprises                                          |
| 11 | [Logs](https://12factor.net/logs)                             | Treat logs as event streams. <br/> Write logs and let the execution environment aggregate and store them, rather than managing log files                                                                 |
| 12 | [Admin processes](https://12factor.net/admin-processes)       | Run admin/management tasks (like migrations or one-off scripts) as one-off processes in the same environment as the app, using the same codebase and config)                                             |
